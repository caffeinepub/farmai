# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build FARMAI, a frontend-only intelligent agriculture platform that helps farmers with crop predictions, cost estimation, profit calculations, and a direct marketplace.

**Planned changes:**
- Create landing page with hero section, problem statement, solution overview, and key objectives
- Build crop prediction interface accepting 7 environmental/soil parameters with mock AI recommendations
- Implement cultivation cost calculator with itemized breakdown for seeds, fertilizers, labor, irrigation, and equipment
- Create profit prediction calculator showing revenue, profit/loss, and margin percentage
- Build farmer dashboard with overview metrics and quick access to tools
- Implement direct marketplace where farmers list crops and buyers can search/filter listings
- Add navigation system connecting all pages (Home, Dashboard, Crop Prediction, Cost Calculator, Profit Calculator, Marketplace)
- Apply agricultural theme with earth tones (greens, browns, warm neutrals) throughout

**User-visible outcome:** Farmers can access a complete web platform to get crop recommendations based on soil conditions, estimate cultivation costs, predict profits, manage a dashboard, and list/browse crops in a direct marketplace—all with a cohesive agricultural design aesthetic.
