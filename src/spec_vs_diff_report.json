  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses most requirements. All major features are present: authentication home page with three distinct sections (Admin, Farmer, Buyer), backend user management with distinct user types and password hashing, protected routes with session management, and proper routing updates. However, some acceptance criteria evidence is missing or unclear due to diff truncation, particularly around error handling specifics and complete form validation flows.",

      "requirement": "The previous landing page content is accessible through a different route (e.g., '/about' or integrated after login)",
      "reason": "The original landing page content appears to have been moved to AboutPage.tsx and is accessible at '/about' route, which satisfies the requirement. However, the diff shows AboutPage.tsx is truncated, so full verification of content preservation is not possible.",
